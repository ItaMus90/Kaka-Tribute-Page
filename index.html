		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kak%C3%A1">Kaká</a> made his professional club debut at age 18 at São Paulo FC in Brazil in 2001. After being named to the Bola de Ouro as the best player in the 2002 Campeonato Brasileiro, in 2003 he joined Italian club A.C. Milan for a fee of €8.5 million. At Milan, the club where he spent his prime years, Kaká won a Serie A title and was named the Serie A Footballer of the Year twice. In 2005, Milan finished runners up in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final to Liverpool F.C., with Kaká, the top assist provider of the tournament, named the UEFA Club Midfielder of the Year. Two years later he led Milan to win the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final and was the tournament's top goal scorer. Kaká's pace, creative passing, goal scoring and dribbles from midfield saw him win the FIFA World Player of the Year, the Ballon d'Or, the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year and the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker awards.

		After his success with Milan, Kaká joined Real Madrid for a transfer fee of €67 million. At the time, this was the second highest transfer fee (in euros) ever, behind only the €77.5 million (150 billion lire) fee for Zinedine Zidane. However, in the same transfer window Real Madrid broke the world record by signing Cristiano Ronaldo. After four injury ravaged seasons in Spain, which saw his physical ability to dribble from midfield rapidly decline, he returned to Milan for a season in 2013, scoring his 100th goal for the club. At the end of the 2013–14 season, he joined MLS expansion club Orlando City, but initially returned to his former Brazilian club São Paulo FC on loan. In 2015, he scored on his MLS debut for Orlando City; he was later included in the roster for the 2015 MLS All-Star Game, where he was named Most Valuable Player.

He was also a member of Brazil's 2005 and 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup-winning squads, winning the Golden Ball Award in the 2009 edition, as the tournament's best player. With success at club and international level, Kaká is one of seven players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or.
